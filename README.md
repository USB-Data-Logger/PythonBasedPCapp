## Description

Briefly describe your project here.

## Prerequisites

- Python 3.x installed
- Git installed (if your project is hosted on a Git repository)

## Installation

Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/jagannathhari/PythonBasedPCapp.git```

Navigate to the project directory:

```bash
cd your-repo
```

Install dependencies:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage

Explain how to use your project once it's installed.

## Development Environment Setup

### Virtual Environment

It's recommended to use a virtual environment to manage project dependencies. If you don't have `virtualenv` installed, you can install it using:

```bash
pip install virtualenv
```

Create a virtual environment:

```bash
virtualenv venv
```

Activate the virtual environment:

- On Windows:

  ```bash
  .\venv\Scripts\activate
  ```

- On macOS/Linux:

  ```bash
  source venv/bin/activate
  ```

### Requirements.txt

The `requirements.txt` file lists all the dependencies for your project. To update it after installing new packages, run:

```bash
pip freeze > requirements.txt
```

## Creating Executable with PyInstaller

To create an executable from your Python script, you can use PyInstaller. Install it using:

```bash
pip install pyinstaller
```

Create the executable:

```bash
pyinstaller COMLogger.spec
```

This will generate a `dist` directory containing the executable.

## Release Binary

Your release binary can be hosted on platforms like GitHub Releases. Provide a link to the latest release in this section.
